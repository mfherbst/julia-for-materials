# Julia for Materials Modelling

This repository contains the Pluto notebooks of the presentation
**Julia for Materials Modelling**, originally held on the 22nd May
at EPFL (see [this memento](https://memento.epfl.ch/event/julia-for-materials-modelling-2/)
for more details).

The Pluto notebooks try to address the **suitability of Julia** for atomistic materials
modelling and they provide an overview of the **current state** of Julia tools
in this field.
