# Julia for Materials Modelling

[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/website-static-blue.svg)](https://mfherbst.github.io/julia-for-materials/)

This repository contains the Pluto notebooks of the presentation
**Julia for Materials Modelling**, originally held on the 24th May 2023
at EPFL (see [this memento](https://memento.epfl.ch/event/julia-for-materials-modelling-2/)
for more details). A [recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dujepKxxxkg) is available
[on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dujepKxxxkg).

The Pluto notebooks try to address the **suitability of Julia** for atomistic materials
modelling and they provide an overview of the **current state** of Julia tools
in this field.

Feel free to take a look at the
[pre-rendered static website of the notebooks](https://mfherbst.github.io/julia-for-materials/)
or the [recording on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dujepKxxxkg).
